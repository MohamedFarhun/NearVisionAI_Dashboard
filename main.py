        - <span style="font-weight:bold; font-size:16px;"> Unified Access:</span> Unlike the separation between Testnet and Mainnet on the official NEAR Blocks,My  dashboard provides a seamless experience by allowing users to switch between Testnet and Mainnet within the same interface. This unified access simplifies the user experience and makes it more convenient to monitor different network environments.
        - <span style="font-weight:bold; font-size:16px;"> Personalized Insights with LLM:</span> Integration of Large Language Models (LLM) for providing personalized insights and summaries is a distinctive feature not present in the official NEAR Blocks dashboards. This allows for more advanced analytics, summaries, and potentially predictive analytics tailored to the user's specific queries and interests, adding a layer of personalized intelligence to blockchain analytics.
        - <span style="font-weight:bold; font-size:16px;"> Comprehensive Health Indicators:</span> My dashboard includes a dedicated section for health indicators of the NEAR protocol. This feature could provide users with a quick overview of the network's performance, security, and reliability metrics, offering a more holistic view of the network's health compared to the basic statistical information available on the official dashboards.
        - <span style="font-weight:bold; font-size:16px;"> Real-Time Anomaly Detection: </span>The feature of real-time insights and anomaly detection in my dashboard could provide significant value by alerting users to unusual activities or potential issues within the network in real time, which is a proactive approach to network monitoring and security.
